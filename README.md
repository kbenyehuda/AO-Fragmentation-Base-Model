# AO-Fragmentation-Base-Model
This repository can be used to take our image database and get their Acridine Orange based DNA Fragmentation levels.(0-1 where 0 is most fragmented and 1 is least).

This code assumes that morphological features per cell image have already been extracted and saved in an excel file ('final_exp_3.xlsx' in this example).

In order to use a different image dataset and extract morphological features, you can look into the relevant morphological feature extraction repository.
A few directories need to be changed to suit the user, as well as the images.

To get different Acridine Orange based DNA Fragmentation Classifiers, please contact me.
